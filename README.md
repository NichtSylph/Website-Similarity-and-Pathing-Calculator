# Website-Similarity-and-Pathing-Calculator
A simple GUI that allows a user to add URL's to a text file and use them for comparison with other URL's to see which other URL has similarities to it based on the keywords that are in the website. 

To utilize, modify the pathing of the SimilarityGUI to load where your URLs are going to be. It utializes a serializable frequency table and hashmap to increase performance.

Once done, launch SimilarityGUI and add a website URL that you'd like to see how much it compares with the others in the cluster.
